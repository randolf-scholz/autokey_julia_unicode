# Third Party Libraries

## $\LaTeX$ package 'comprehensive'

The [comprehensive](https://ctan.org/pkg/comprehensive) package is a collection of symbols and macros for $\LaTeX$. We can use it as a reference for $\LaTeX$ macros that can be used to substitute unicode characters when using `pdflatex`.

## Unicode Character Database

The [Unicode Character Database](https://www.unicode.org/ucd/) is a collection of files that define the properties of all Unicode characters. We can use it to generate a list of all unicode characters that are supported by our system.
